# 01. VLAN Configuration on a Cisco Switch (Packet Tracer)

This project demonstrates secure LAN segmentation on a Cisco switch using Virtual Local Area Networks (**VLANs**). Instead of using the default and insecure VLAN 1, the network has been divided into two independent VLANs: **VLAN 10 (Office)** and **VLAN 20 (Guests)**.

### Addressing and Port Assignment Table:

| Device | Switch Port | Department / Purpose | VLAN | IP Address | Subnet Mask |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **PC0** | FastEthernet 0/1 | Office | **10** | `192.168.1.1` | `255.255.255.0` |
| **PC1** | FastEthernet 0/2 | Office | **10** | `192.168.1.2` | `255.255.255.0` |
| **PC2** | FastEthernet 0/3 | Guests | **20** | `192.168.1.3` | `255.255.255.0` |
| **PC3** | FastEthernet 0/4 | Guests | **20** | `192.168.1.4` | `255.255.255.0` |

## 🛠️ Configuration Guide (CLI Script)

To replicate this configuration, log into the switch's Command Line Interface (**CLI**) and execute the following commands:

### Creating and Configuring VLAN 10 and VLAN 20
```text
enable
configure terminal

vlan 10
name Office
exit

interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
no shutdown
exit

vlan 20
name Guests
exit

interface range fastEthernet 0/3 - 4
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20
no shutdown
exit
```
### 💾 Saving the Configuration
After separating the devices into different VLANs, save the data permanently to non-volatile memory (NVRAM) with this command:
```text
do write memory
```

# 02. Basic Inter-Subnet Routing via Cisco Router (Packet Tracer)

This project demonstrates how to connect two separate Local Area Networks (LANs) using a Cisco Router as a Default Gateway. The network is divided into two distinct subnets: `192.168.1.0/24` (left side) and `192.168.2.0/24` (right side), allowing secure and controlled communication between different network segments.

## 🛠️ Configuration Guide (CLI Script)

To replicate this configuration, log into the **Router2** Command Line Interface (**CLI**) and execute the following commands to assign IP addresses and activate the interfaces:

### Router Configuration
```text
enable
configure terminal

! Configure the Left Subnet Gateway (Switch0 side)
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.10 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
 do write memory
exit

! Configure the Right Subnet Gateway (Switch1 side)
interface GigabitEthernet0/1

# 03. Static Routing Configuration Between Two Cisco Routers (Packet Tracer)

This project demonstrates how to connect two separate Local Area Networks (LANs) across a point-to-point Wide Area Network (WAN) link using two Cisco Routers and Static Routing. The network is segmented into three distinct subnets: 192.168.1.0/24 (left LAN), 10.0.1.0/24 (transit WAN link), and 192.168.2.0/24 (right LAN), enabling secure and explicit routing boundaries between different network branches.
